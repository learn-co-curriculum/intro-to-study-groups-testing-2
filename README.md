# Study Groups

Study groups are another way for you to reap the rewards of the Learn community. While Ask a Question allows you to get and give help on a specific problem, Study Groups offer a way to work with others on any individual lesson or general concept.
 
## Learn with others online at the same time

In days past, you may have assembled a group of friends at a library or coffee shop to review difficult concepts, prepare for an exam, or just sit and work together to stay motivated. It's a natural thing to want to do with friends.

Study groups on Learn offer you a way to do that in the digital world. When a study group begins, we create a private slack channel just for the group and prompt users to join it in Learn. We also place a link to a video chat in the channel so you can see and speak to all the people in your group.

You can both create and join study groups from the right rail on lesson pages, from your dashboard when you login to learn.co, or on the dedicated [study group page](www.learn.co/study-groups) which is accessible on the upper right menu.

## When to use it

There are plenty of reasons to create a study group. Here are some that come to mind for us or that we’ve seen your fellow Learners do. You could make a study group to:

- solve a lab together. 
- review a lab you’ve completed to solidify your understanding or compare solutions. 
- dedicate a few hours to churning through an entire unit together. 
- pair program on a lab or project together.
- discuss a general concept or idea that confused you.
- just be online with others and stay motivated while each of you works on different material.

You’ll sometimes see Learn instructors use study groups to do lectures or code alongs. Learners have even created study groups to organize in-person meet ups across the world! 

In general, Study Groups are valuable anytime you’re doing something that would be better with other Learners.

## Going forward

In your Learn journey, you will inevitably encounter obstacles, feel lapses in motivation, need to review a hazy concept, or just want to know you’re not in this alone. At those times,  look for existing study groups or create new ones. [some nice ending line?]
